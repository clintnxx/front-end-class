  <h1>The Future of Poultry Farming: Battery Cages</h1>
  <h3>Why Battery Cages Are Changing the Game for Farmers</h3>
  <p>
    Battery cages are a modern poultry farming system designed to maximize egg production efficiency while minimizing space usage.
    With proper ventilation, feeding systems, and waste management, battery cages help farmers manage large flocks easily and maintain hygiene.
    Though controversial in some regions due to animal welfare concerns, many farmers still adopt them for their economic benefits.
    It's important to choose high-quality cages that ensure the comfort and health of the birds.
